# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Spam-Email-Detection
Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms used for <b>ENRON</b> spam Email dataset
</br>
<p font size="20">The aim of this project is to tackle the significant issue of spam e-mails by detecting them using <b>supervised machine learning techniques</b>, which will help to filter spam emails more efficiently compared to traditional techniques or manual methods in which negative lists of spammers, list of authentic senders, and selected list of words in email content or subject are considered for developing anti-spam filter. By using machine learning techniques we won’t have to rely on such traditional ways of filtering spam as they prove to be inefficient in today’s times due to the fore fold increase in such emails and spammers sending special mails to bypass these manual methods.</p>

<h3>
The algorithms used for this implementation are:</br>
<b>1. Naive Bayes Algorithm </b>(Python implementation)
<b>2. Perceptron Algorithm </b>(JAVA implementation)
<b>3. C4.5 Algorithm </b>(JAVA implementation)
